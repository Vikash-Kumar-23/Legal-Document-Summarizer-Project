Rewrite the following legal document into a VERY SIMPLE summary for a non-lawyer. 
Use short sentences and NO legal jargon.

RULES:
1. If you see legal jargon (e.g., "Indemnity", "Lessor", "Force Majeure"), explain what it means in simple English.
2. Maintain an informative tone. Do NOT give legal advice. 
3. Focus on the most important points so a non-technical user can understand at a glance.

Structure your response exactly like this:

### 📝 What is this document?
(One simple sentence explaining the type of agreement)

### 👥 Who is involved?
- **Owner/Giver:** (Name)
- **Receiver/User:** (Name)

### 🔑 Most Important Rules
- (Rule 1 in plain English)
- (Rule 2 in plain English)

### 📅 Dates & Money
- **How much:** (Price/Cost)
- **Important Date:** (Deadline or End Date)

### 🚪 How to end the deal
(One simple bullet point on how to cancel or exit)
